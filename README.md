## User Stories
### Student Stories:
- "As a student, I want to create a profile so that I can store my academic and professional information."
- "As a student, I want to generate a CV tailored to a specific job role so that it highlights my most relevant skills."
- "As a student, I want to select from different CV templates so that I can choose a design that best represents me."
### Employer Stories:
- "As an employer, I want to search for students with specific skills so that I can find suitable candidates."
- "As an employer, I want to view CVs tailored to job roles so that I can quickly assess candidatesâ€™ qualifications."

## Backlog
The backlog will include tasks derived from user stories and prioritized for development. Each story should be broken down into smaller tasks for implementation and ordered based on relevance and dependencies. Our progress is tracked on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/yYTxEn3y/jobsnap).

# CI/CD Workflow and Work Environments

We used GitHub to maintain an organized workflow, which helped us detect and resolve bugs and conflicts early. Each team member worked on their own branch. After completing their tasks, they created merge requests to integrate changes into the main branch. This structured approach ensured smooth collaboration and maintained code quality.

___

## Manual Testing

All backend and frontend tests were conducted manually. These tests included:

### Backend:
- Testing business logic through specific scenarios using predefined input data.
- Validating interactions with the Oracle database.

### Frontend:
- Verifying the user interface to ensure functionality is correct and intuitive.
- Testing the integration between frontend and backend for key workflows (e.g., signup, login, profile management).

---

## Automated Testing

In addition to manual testing, we implemented automated tests for the backend using the `Mock` framework. These tests were designed to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the core business logic, focusing on three key areas:

### CV Management
- **Purpose:** Validate operations related to CV creation, retrieval, and deletion.
- **Tests include:**
  - Saving CVs and verifying repository interactions.
  - Fetching CVs by user ID and ensuring the correct list is returned.
  - Handling error scenarios such as deleting or retrieving non-existent CVs.

### Profile Management
- **Purpose:** Test profile operations like retrieving and updating user profile details.
- **Tests include:**
  - Retrieving profiles by ID and verifying that the correct details are returned.
  - Handling cases where a profile does not exist.
  - Updating profile details and ensuring the changes are correctly saved in the database.
  - Validating error handling when attempting to update a non-existent profile.

### Authentication (Login and Signup)
- **Purpose:** Ensure the authentication system functions correctly, allowing users to sign up and log in securely.
- **Tests include:**
  - Verifying user registration, ensuring that valid user details are saved in the database.
  - Testing login functionality with valid credentials to ensure successful authentication.
  - Handling incorrect credentials gracefully by returning appropriate error messages.
  - Ensuring the security of sensitive operations, such as password hashing and validation.

These automated tests were designed to increase the overall quality of the application by identifying potential issues early and ensuring the robustness of critical functionality.

## Automated Testing

In addition to manual testing, we integrated automated tests using the `Mock` framework for several key services. These tests focused on improving reliability, ensuring the correctness of critical functionalities, and handling edge cases effectively.

### **CV Service Tests**
Automated tests were added for the `CVService` to:
- Validate saving and retrieving CVs, ensuring proper interactions with the `CVRepository`.
- Handle error scenarios, such as attempting to delete or find a CV that does not exist.
- Verify the functionality of fetching CVs by user ID and retrieving all CVs in the system.

### **Profile Service Tests**
Automated tests were implemented for the `ProfileService` to:
- Ensure profiles can be retrieved by ID.
- Validate profile updates, including changes to names and other attributes.
- Handle scenarios where the profile being updated does not exist.

### **Authentication Tests**
Authentication-related tests were added to verify the robustness of signup and login functionalities:
- **Signup Tests:**
  - Validate successful account creation for both students and employers.
  - Ensure invalid roles are correctly rejected with an appropriate error message.
- **Login Tests:**
  - Confirm successful logins for both student and employer roles.
  - Ensure invalid credentials are rejected, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Token Generation:**
  - Validate the creation of secure JWT tokens containing the correct claims (e.g., email).

These tests simulate various user scenarios, including both successful operations and failures, ensuring the authentication process is reliable and secure.
