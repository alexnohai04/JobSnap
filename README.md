## Non-Functional Requirements and Solutions (Short)

1. **Performance**: <2s response time using Spring Boot, optimized SQL, and Redis caching.  
2. **Scalability**: Microservices, load balancer, and cloud auto-scaling.  
3. **Security**: OAuth 2.0, AES-256 encryption, input validation, HTTPS.  
4. **Availability**: 99.9% uptime with monitoring, backups, and redundancy.  
5. **Usability**: ReactJS, user testing, and interactive guides.  
6. **Portability**: Responsive design and cross-device testing.  
7. **Maintainability**: Standardized code, documentation, and automated testing.  


# CI/CD Workflow and Work Environments

We used GitHub to maintain an organized workflow, which helped us detect and resolve bugs and conflicts early. Each team member worked on their own branch. After completing their tasks, they created merge requests to integrate changes into the main branch. This structured approach ensured smooth collaboration and maintained code quality.

## Application Execution

### Backend:
- Implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework.
- Configured to connect to a local Oracle Database instance via a configuration file (`application.properties`).

### Frontend:
- Implemented in React.
- Run locally using the command:
  ```bash
  npm start


# Work Environments

## DEV (Development)
- **Purpose:** Initial development and testing of functionalities.
- **Setup:**
  - Backend and frontend run locally.
  - Oracle database configured locally with mock data.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Debugging enabled for rapid issue identification.
  - Detailed logging in the backend for tracking workflows.

## STAGING (Final Testing)
- **Purpose:** Simulating a production-like environment.
- **Setup:**
  - Backend and frontend continue to run locally, with testing using data closer to real-world scenarios.
  - Oracle database populated with semi-real data.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Complete manual testing to verify main functionalities and integration.

## PRODUCTION
- **Purpose:** Running the application for end-users (locally).
- **Setup:**
  - Application run locally by the team; not hosted on a public server.
  - Oracle database contains real data required for application functionality.
- **Characteristics:**
  - Minor optimizations for performance.
  - Final manual testing before running the application.

## Manual Testing

All backend and frontend tests were conducted manually. These tests included:

### Backend:
- Testing business logic through specific scenarios using predefined input data.
- Validating interactions with the Oracle database.

### Frontend:
- Verifying the user interface to ensure functionality is correct and intuitive.
- Testing the integration between frontend and backend for key workflows (e.g., signup, login, profile management).
