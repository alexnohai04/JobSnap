# **CI/CD Workflow and Environment Descriptions**

## **CI/CD Overview**
We implemented a CI/CD pipeline using **GitHub Actions** to automate testing and ensure code quality across all environments. The pipeline is triggered on every commit or pull request, running unit tests to validate core functionalities.

The pipeline focuses on automating **backend unit tests** and verifying that changes do not break existing functionality. Since the database, backend, and frontend are all hosted locally, the CI/CD pipeline ensures a consistent development process.

---

## **Environment Descriptions**
Our development workflow relies on three local environments:

### **DEV (Development)**
- **Purpose**: 
  - Initial development and debugging of features.
- **Setup**:
  - Backend runs locally using Spring Boot (`mvn spring-boot:run`).
  - Frontend runs locally using React (`npm start`).
  - Oracle database configured locally with mock data.
- **Key Features**:
  - Debugging enabled for rapid issue identification.
  - Detailed logging for backend workflows.
  - CI/CD pipeline runs **unit tests** to validate changes during development.

### **STAGING (Final Testing)**
- **Purpose**:
  - Simulate a production-like environment for final validation.
- **Setup**:
  - Backend and frontend continue to run locally.
  - Oracle database populated with semi-real data for testing.
- **Key Features**:
  - Manual and automated testing, including integration validation.
  - CI/CD pipeline executes **unit tests** for final validation.

### **PRODUCTION**
- **Purpose**:
  - Serve the final application to end-users.
- **Setup**:
  - Backend, frontend, and Oracle database all run locally on the production machine.
  - Database contains real data for actual use cases.
- **Key Features**:
  - Final manual testing is performed before deployment.
  - CI/CD pipeline validates deployment.
